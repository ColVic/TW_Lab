## Lab 1
---

During this laboratory I applied my gained knowledge about Bootstrap 3 in the following way:
- created a index.html page with a welcome element called `jumbotron` in bootsrap
- setted up the responsiveness for 6 elements that I have on the homepage
  - initially, posts are set in 3 columns
  - on small screens - in 2 columns
  - on extra small screens - 1 column

- changed the default value of `jumbotron` backgroung color and created a nice space between elements using `padding` attribute
- added few more static pages
  - in contact page I added a form and made it responsive

I understood the improtance of putting the `style.css` file after `bootstrap.css` in order to ovrwrite it's default styles.

I found this technology pretty simple and no wonder why a lot of websites use it to make user experience more pleasant.
